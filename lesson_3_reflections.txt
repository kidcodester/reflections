When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all work local?

	So that you might collaborate with others or contribute from a different machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	In order to make sure you stay synced with master copy before making any of your own changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A clone is an entire copy of a repository for which auxiliary changes such as origin/destination for git must be made
by the user in the git flow process.  A fork is like a clone whose tasks are handled on the remote server by GitHub
and it tracks the number of forks made of a source user's repository.  Forks may be pulled down to the local user machine for further
work in the git flow process (with changes requiring commits to be pushed back to master forked (cloned) repository on GitHub).
A branch is splintering of a given project (say from master) to try out/test new features which might not necessarily belong or need
to belong in master.
