When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all work local?

	So that you might collaborate with others or contribute from a different machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	In order to make sure you stay synced with master copy before making any of your own changes.
